## NOTE:

This is a new version where I uptaded the mealplanner generator code following my personal Full Stack DelissBeer Project -> [DelissBeer App](https://github.com/dianacpg/deliss_beer)

## FoodyMealPlanner

We created a web app that generates automatically weekly meal plans; - This generator was created by manipulating data from EDAMAM API with millions of recipes; - Users can filter by their type of diet: Standard, Vegetarian or Vegan; - We also display a daily motivational quote;

_Caution: The free EDAMAM API plan an API calls limit to 10/minute and does not allow to cash data!_

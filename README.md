## FoodyMealPlanner

We created a web app that generates automatically weekly meal plans; - This generator was created by manipulating data from EDAMAM API with millions of recipes; - Users can filter by their type of diet: Standard, Vegetarian or Vegan; - We also display a daily motivational quote;

_Caution: The free EDAMAM API plan has a limitation of 10 API calss per minute and does not allow to cash data!_

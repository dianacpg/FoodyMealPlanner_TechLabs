## NOTE:

**This is a new version where I updated the Meal Plan Generator code following my personal Full Stack DelissBeer Project -> [DelissBeer App](https://github.com/dianacpg/deliss_beer)**

## FoodyMealPlanner

We created a react app that generates automatically weekly meal plans; - This generator was made by manipulating data from EDAMAM API with millions of recipes; - Users can filter by their type of diet: Standard, Vegetarian or Vegan; - We also display a daily motivational quote;

_Caution: The free EDAMAM API plan has a limitation of 10 API calss per minute and does not allow to cash data!_
